# Twitter-Analysis: Canada Goose
![](https://github.com/SJ666666/Twitter-Analysis/blob/master/coyote.jpg)
This is my final project for MA615.
The code is in [Twitter Analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/SJ666666/Twitter-Analysis/blob/master/Twitter%20Analysis.Rmd).
The report is [Twitter_Analysis.pdf](https://github.com/SJ666666/Twitter-Analysis/blob/master/Twitter_Analysis.pdf).
The presentation slides are in [Twitter_Analysis_Presentation_reduced.html](https://github.com/SJ666666/Twitter-Analysis/blob/master/Twitter_Analysis_Presentation_reduced.html).
However, the file is too large for github to display. 
The pdf format for the slides are also available [Twitter_Analysis_Presentation_reduced.pdf](https://github.com/SJ666666/Twitter-Analysis/blob/master/Twitter_Analysis_Presentation_reduced.pdf).
The script of shiny app is in [shiny_tweet_text.R](https://github.com/SJ666666/Twitter-Analysis/blob/master/shiny_tweet_text.R).
It is also available at [here](https://shuyij.shinyapps.io/twitter-analysis/).
